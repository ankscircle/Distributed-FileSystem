We provide the following features as a part of enhancement to the basic DFS:

1. Secured login: Our DFS requires the user to login with his username and password before being given access to the Server.

2. Volume Structure at the server: Each user is allocated a separate folder at the server side. The user is allowed access only to his directory.

3. Backup Server: We have designed our file system to have an automatic backup system at a different server location. This backup server would contain all the user data created at the master server.
